    "At the end of the last notebook we noticed that if we wanted to make nicer plots of the potential in a 2D region that we were going to have to compute the potential on lattices with more and more points. When you don't change the extension of a space that you are discretizing, but you increase the number of lattice points in its discretization, we call that making a finer lattice and the process refinement. For the example of the 2D square and rectangular lattices we have been considering, this means that we keep $\\ell_x$ and $\\ell_y$ fixed while increasing the number of lattice points, $N_x$ and $N_y$, in each direction. \n",

Our task in this notebook, then, is to write a function that will solve the equation on a lattice with a user specified number of lattice points. Let's break this into manageable steps.\n",

This matrix should only involve the interior points of the lattice and so it does not have dimensions $(N_x\\cdot N_y) \\times (N_x \\cdot N_y)$. Before you begin programming work out what dimensions it does have. Use the $M$ of the $5\\times 5$ lattice you worked on in the last notebook as an example to help you generalize to this case. Test your new function by making sure that it reproduces the correct $M$ for the $5\\times5$ lattice. "

For this excercise, use the same boundary conditions as in the last notebook, namely: (i) along three of the walls, those at $x=0$, $x=1$, and at $y=0$, the plates are grounded; and (ii) at $y=1$ the potential is $V(x,y=1)=\\sin(\\pi x)$.
